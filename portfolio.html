	<h2 align="center">UX Internship at Waygo (June 2015 - August 2015)</h2>

	<!-- <h5 align="center"><i> Waygo is a East Asian translation iOS/Android application that does all its translations offline (without Internet) using optical character recognition.</i></h5> -->

	<h4 align="center">My objective for the summer: improving user retention</h4>

	<h3 id="section">Identifying the problem</h3>
	<div class="body">
		<p>I approached this problem by first creating a basic user flow of the app.</p>
		<img id="flowchart" src="Images/flowchart.jpg">
		<p>Then, with mobile analytic programs, I identified the parts of the app where the user drop off was the highest. 
		Once I found that the onboarding process had the highest drop off rate, I concluded that some of the possibilities for this occurrence were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The guide was not clear enough</li>
			<li>Users were not expecting Waygo to be a paid app</li>
			<li>Users could not find the language they wanted</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<h3 id="section">Action</h3>
	<div class="body">
		<p> I decided that changing the onboarding guide would be a good first step because a new guide could clear up confusion about the free trial and languages offered. I studied the onboarding guides of various apps such as Google Translate and Slack to see how their users were introduced to their apps. After studying these apps, I worked with the Waygo team to come up with a different onboarding guide.</p>

	<h3 id="section">User Testing</h3>
	<div class="body">
		<p>I conducted user tests through arranged meetings and at cafes. At these meetings, I observed users as they went through the onboarding process and made a few translations using the app. I asked them questions about certain aspects of the app and used a screen/voice recording software so that I could review their feedback.</p>
	</div>

	<h3 id="section">Conclusion</h3>
	<div class="body">
		<p>By the end of my internship with Waygo, I had gone through one round of testing the new onboarding guide and was able to pass on my notes to the Waygo team. </p>
